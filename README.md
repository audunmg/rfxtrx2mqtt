# RFXTRX 2 MQTT

A simple RFXTRX 433 Mhz to MQTT bridge.

A young project, but I am using it and it is working well.

# Limitations

- Currently read-only. So it'll work with sensors and control but you can't 
  send anything yet. I would like that, but I don't personally need it yet. If
  this is something that you want/need and are motivated to help I'd be happy
  to help you!

## Why?

I found various projects...

- https://thingsmatic.com/2018/01/07/rfxtrx433e-node-red-mqtt-and-home-assistant/
- https://github.com/Anton04/RFXcom-MQTT-bridge
- https://community.home-assistant.io/t/rfxtrx433e-to-mqtt/105665
- https://github.com/IcyPalm/RFXCOM-MQTT-bridge

None of them seemed to fit the bill.
